## Current Objective
- Fix errors occurring when submitting questions in the flashcard application
- Deploy the flashcard application to the internet for mobile and laptop access.

## Context
- App encountered two issues:
  1. Error at line 311 in app.py: `chosen_display = ", ".join(sorted(list(user_answers_set)))` 
  2. Bug where questions with only one option would show "No answer provided" when submitted

- Fixed both issues by:
  1. Implementing safer handling of user_answers_set with proper validation
  2. Adding special handling for questions with only one option to auto-select them
  3. Updating UI to show users when an option is auto-selected
  4. Ensuring session state tracks selections correctly for all question types

- Previous interaction issues with the application had already been fixed:
  1. Radio button selection issues resolved with selection tracking
  2. Button flow improved with cleaner UI
  3. Submit and Next button issues resolved

- User now wants to deploy the application to access it from phone and laptop.

## Next Steps
- Test the application to verify all fixes work correctly
- Set up a GitHub repository for the application
- Deploy the application using a cloud service like Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
- Provide instructions for accessing the deployed application
