## Current Objective
- Fix error occurring when submitting questions in the flashcard application
- Deploy the flashcard application to the internet for mobile and laptop access.

## Context
- App was generally working well but encountered an error sometimes when submitting questions
- The error occurred at line 311 in app.py: `chosen_display = ", ".join(sorted(list(user_answers_set)))`
- Fixed the issue by implementing safer handling of user_answers_set and properly validating user answers before processing

- Previous interaction issues with the application have been successfully fixed:
  1. Radio button selection issues resolved with selection tracking
  2. Button flow improved with cleaner UI
  3. Submit and Next button issues resolved

- User now wants to deploy the application to access it from phone and laptop.

## Next Steps
- Test the application to verify the error has been fixed
- Set up a GitHub repository for the application
- Deploy the application using a cloud service like Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
- Provide instructions for accessing the deployed application
