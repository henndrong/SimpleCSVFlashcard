## Current Objective
- Fix user interaction issues in the flashcard application.

## Context
- The application was experiencing several interaction issues:
  1. Users needed to click twice when changing radio button selections
  2. The "Next Card" button required two clicks to move to the next flashcard
  3. The Submit Answer button was sometimes disabled when it should be enabled
  4. After answering, having both Submit Answer (disabled) and Next Card buttons created visual clutter

- These issues have been resolved by:
  1. Implementing a change detection system for radio buttons that tracks previous selections
  2. Adding explicit st.rerun() calls at strategic points to force immediate UI updates
  3. Fixing the Submit Answer button's disabled state logic based on input type
  4. Redesigning the button flow to replace "Submit Answer" with "Next Card" after submission

## Next Steps
- Present the improved application to the user.
- Continue monitoring for any additional UI/UX issues.
